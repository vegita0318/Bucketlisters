# Bucketlisters

Bucketlisters is a REACT app that allows users to login and create a bucket list to be shared with other online users. The app is used to connect users who may have similiar activities on their bucket list and want someone to complete the activities with. Bucketlisters focuses on the exciting joy of creating a bucket list and fulfilling them. The app will also allow users to check off completed activities. A contact page will allow users to email each other if they share a bucketlist item and want a partner to join in, so that they can both check them off of their lists. A youTube search is embedded if users want to see others participating in specific activities, before choosing it as their own bucketlist item.
